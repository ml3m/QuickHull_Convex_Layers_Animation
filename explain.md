# Explanation: Convex Layers Animation

This program visualizes the iterative construction of convex layers (or shells)
from a set of 2D points using Matplotlib and animation. Below is a step-by-step
breakdown of how the code works:

### 1. **Generate Random Points**
- Using `numpy`, the code generates a set of random 2D points within a 100x100
  grid.
- These points serve as the input for computing convex layers.

```python points = np.random.rand(num_points, 2) * 100 ```

### 2. **Compute Convex Layers**
- The `compute_convex_layers` function computes multiple convex hulls
  iteratively:
  1. The outermost convex hull is computed using `scipy.spatial.ConvexHull`.
  2. Points forming the hull are saved as a layer.
  3. These points are removed, and the process repeats until fewer than 3
  points remain.

```python while len(remaining_points) > 2: hull = ConvexHull(remaining_points)
layers.append(remaining_points[hull.vertices]) remaining_points =
np.delete(remaining_points, hull.vertices, axis=0) ```

### 3. **Setup for Animation**
- A Matplotlib figure and axes are created.
- The points are plotted using `ax.scatter`.
- A red line is initialized to represent the convex hull of each layer.

```python scat = ax.scatter(points[:, 0], points[:, 1], c='blue',
label='Points') line, = ax.plot([], [], 'r-', lw=2, label='Convex Hull') ```

### 4. **Animation Logic**
- The animation is handled by `matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation`:
  - **`init` Function**: Initializes the line as empty.
  - **`animate` Function**: Updates the line with the current convex layer's
    points, forming a closed loop.
  - **Blitting**: Optimizes rendering by redrawing only the updated objects
    (`scat` and `line`).

```python def init(): line.set_data([], []) return scat, line

def animate(i): if i < len(convex_layers): layer = convex_layers[i] x, y =
np.append(layer[:, 0], layer[0, 0]), np.append(layer[:, 1], layer[0, 1])
line.set_data(x, y) return scat, line ```

### 5. **Display the Animation**
- `FuncAnimation` animates the layers frame-by-frame, showing the points and
  the current convex hull.
- `plt.legend()` adds a legend, and `plt.show()` displays the animation.

```python ani = FuncAnimation(fig, animate, frames=len(convex_layers),
init_func=init, blit=True, interval=1000, repeat=False) plt.show() ```

### Summary The animation demonstrates how convex layers are extracted from a
set of points step-by-step, visually highlighting the concept of iterative
convex hull computation.
